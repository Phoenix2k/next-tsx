## Testing

All test related files are located under `__tests__`, except a few configs which are found in the root of the project.

#### Run all tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

This will run both the end-to-end tests as well as the unit tests.

#### Run CI tests

```sh
$ npm test:ci
```

This will skip certain steps such as creating screenshots and videos as well as the coverage report generated by Jest.

#### End-to-end tests (Cypress)

```sh
$ npm run test:e2e
```

Screenshots and videos will be generated in the `cypress` folder.

#### Unit tests (Jest)

```sh
$ npm run test:unit
```

A full coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` folder. To access it, open the
`index.html` file in your browser, which is located in the `lcov-report` folder.

#### Update snapshots

```sh
$ npm run test:update
```
