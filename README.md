- [Cypress][cypress]
- [Emotion][emotion]
- [ESLint][eslint]
- [GitHub workflow][github-workflow]
- [Husky][husky]
- [Jest][jest]
- [Prettier][prettier]
- [React][react-js] + [Next.js][next-js]
- [Stylelint][stylelint]
- [TypeScript][typescript]

## Requirements

- [Node.js][node]

## Installation

```sh
$ npm run install
```

## Development

### Serve with hot reload

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Default location: [`http://localhost:3000/`][localhost]

### Build for production and launch server

```sh
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

Files will be generated in the `.next` folder.

### Export static version

```sh
$ npm run export
```

Files will be generated in the `dist` folder.

### Testing

All tests related files are located under `__tests__`, except a few configs which are found in the root of the project.

#### Run all tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

This will run both the end-to-end tests as well as the unit tests.

#### Run CI tests

```sh
$ npm test:ci
```

This will skip certain steps such as creating screenshots and videos as well as the coverage report generated by Jest.

#### End-to-end tests (Cypress)

```sh
$ npm run test:e2e
```

Screenshots and videos will be generated in the `cypress` folder.

#### Unit tests (Jest)

```sh
$ npm run test:unit
```

A full coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` folder. To access it, open the
`index.html` file in your browser which is located in the `lcov-report` folder.

#### Update snapshots

```sh
$ npm run test:update
```
